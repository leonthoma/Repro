Coding:
  - How good is the  model? Predictie precision, accuracy, performance of data (e.g. MSE, 
  - posterior predictive (graphical) check
  - Model diagnostics
    - Test run with limited number of iterations
    - Get an Idea of the "goodness" of the model
  - Add resgression line to plots
  - Confidence intervals
  - Ancova?
  - Graphics (for final presentation (and report))

R-Script to hand in:
  - merge relevant scripts to one
  - assure its executable
  - Structure in a meamimgfull way
  - comment commands


Final Presentation:
  - structure
  - Include Graphics
  - Content
    - what we learned
    - could our hypothesis be validated ?
    - Estimate how "good" the paper is
  
  
  
 Report: -> 
  - Create "template"/Layout
  - Structure
  - Content: Bullet points for a start
      - what did the authors do
      - Motivation for the re-analysis
          highly anticipated, a lot of attention
      - why could there be a problem with it
      - how we checked for this problem/hypothesis
      - Rule out or estimate the value of the decline
      - why we are doing that? 
      - what do we expect?
      - could our hypothesis be validated ?
      - Estimate how "good" the paper is
  - Graphics (? maybe not, because of limited space)
  - Ressources/Literature database (I would recommend Bibtext/JAbref, easy to connect to markdown and/or Latex
