## Main Results of the Paper
* ~ 75 % decline in flying insect biomass over 27 years
* On protected sites of nature conservation
* Independent on weather, land-use, habitat characteristics
* ~ 80 % of the effects explaining declines are unknown
* Highest losses in times of highest biomass

## Impact of the paper / relevance
* Included in 9 Wikipedia articles
* ~ 1915 tweets about the paper
* Broad media coverage
* something reliable on relevance for politics?

## Data gathering
* Entomological Society Krefeld
* Standardized protocol
* Malaise traps (~ every 11 days emptied)
* catchments between 1989 and 2016
* All locations within protected areas (Nature reserves, Natura 2000, Protected landscape areas)

## Description of the dataset
* Data collected between 1989 and 2016 (96 unique location-year combinations)
* Mostly one sample per location
* samples spanning from spring to autmumn, diverse sampling duration
* Predictor variables collected from various sources
 + Aerial photographs, Plant inventories, 169 climate stations

## The insect biomass model of Hallmann et al.
* Different exposure times of insect traps / catchinng intervals
+ induces heterodescadicity
* Biomass can take positive values
* Biomass is modeled as sum of expected latent biomass
+ mass is assumed to be normaly distributed over the sum of latent expected daily mass
+ Latent daily biomass is represented by log-normal distribution

## Biomass modelling part 2
+ Something about the bayesian statistics...
+ Jags modeling
* they use very broad priors, so probably no biase towards this

## Bayesian Modeling
| Frequentist | Bayesian |
| ---- | ---- |
| Probability is "long-run frequency" | Probability is "degree of certainty" |
| $P(X \mid \theta)$ is a sampling distribution | $P(X \mid \theta)$ is a likelihood |
| "How likely is the data given our parameters" | "How likely is the parameter given our data" |
| No prior | Prior |
| Confidence Intervals | Credibility Intervals |

## Regression towards the mean

## Regression towards the mean

## What is critical about the paper / improvement
* Unknown procedure of plot selection (stage of data collection)
* No "control" plots
* Is there a bias towards plots richer in biomass at the beginning
* Unbalanced study design, some plots are observed twice, some not
* Huge uncertainty about drivers of the decline

## How are we planning to reanalyse it
* not using all years of plots
+ to treat for regression towards the mean


## Further description of Our plan to reanalyse it

## what do we expect from our reanalysis
* a qualified guess, if regression to the mean influenced the results of this paper
* Assessing the quality of the stated decline on insect biomass
* Development of our skills in bayesian statistics

## How could our reanalysis be restricted
* We will not find further predictors nor explain effects of temporal change
*
