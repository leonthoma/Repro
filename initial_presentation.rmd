## Main Results of the Paper
* ~ 75 % decline in flying insect biomass over 27 years
* On protected sites of nature conservation
* Independent on weather, land-use, habitat characteristics
* ~ 80 % of the effects explaining declines are unknown
* Highest losses in times of highest biomass

## Impact of the paper / relevance
* Included in 9 Wikipedia articles
* ~ 1915 tweets about the paper
* Broad media coverage
* something reliable on relevance for politics?

## Description of the dataset
* Data collected between 1989 and 2016 (96 unique location-year combinations)
* Mostly one sample per location
* samples spanning from spring to autmumn, diverse sampling durations
* Predictor variables collected from variouns sources

## The insect biomass model of Hallmann et al.
* Different exposure times of insect traps / catchinng intervals
+ induces heterodescadicity
* Biomass can take positive values
* Biomass is modeled as sum of expected latent biomass
+ mass is assumed to be normaly distributed over the sum of latent expected daily mass
+ Latent daily biomass is represented by log-normal distribution

## Biomass modelling part 2
+ Something about the bayesian statistics...
+ Jags modeling
* they use very broad priors, so probably no biase towards this

## Bayesian Modeling
| Frequentist | Bayesian |
| ---- | ---- |
| Probability is "long-run frequency" | Probability is "degree of certainty" |
| $P(X \mid \theta)$ is a sampling distribution | $P(X \mid \theta)$ is a likelihood |
| "How likely is the data given our parameters" | "How likely is the parameter given our data" |
| No prior | Prior |
| Confidence Intervals | Credibility Intervals |

## What is critical about the paper / improvement
* regression towards the mean?
 + Did the people sampling data favor good positions?
* Unknown covariate has to be something else, maybe plot selection

## How are we planning to reanalyse it
* not using all years of plots
+ to treat for regression towards the mean

## Further description of Our plan to reanalyse it

## what do we expect from our reanalysis

## How could our reanalysis be restricted
