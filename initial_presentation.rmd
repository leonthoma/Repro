## Main Results of the Paper
* ~ 75 % decline in flying insect biomass over 27 years
* On protected sites of nature conservation
* Independent on weather, land-use, habitat characteristics
* ~ 80 % of the effects explaining declines are unknown
* Highest losses in times of highest biomass

## Impact of the paper / relevance
* Included in 9 Wikipedia articles
* ~ 1915 tweets about the paper
* Broad media coverage
* something reliable on relevance for politics?

## Data gathering
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="33%"}
knitr::include_graphics("decline_on_ins_biom.PNG")
```
* Entomological Society Krefeld
* Standardized protocol
* Malaise traps (*~ every 11 days emptied)
* catchments between 1989 and 2016
* All locations within protected areas (Nature reserves, Natura 2000, Protected landscape areas)

## Description of the dataset
* Data collected between 1989 and 2016 (96 unique location-year combinations)
* Mostly one sample per location
* samples spanning from spring to autmumn, diverse sampling duration
* Predictor variables collected from various sources
 + Aerial photographs, Plant inventories, 169 climate stations

## The insect biomass model of Hallmann et al.
* Different exposure times of insect traps / catchinng intervals
+ induces heterodescadicity
* Biomass can take positive values
* Biomass is modeled as sum of expected latent biomass
+ mass is assumed to be normaly distributed over the sum of latent expected daily mass
+ Latent daily biomass is represented by log-normal distribution

## Biomass modelling part 2
+ Something about the bayesian statistics...
+ Jags modeling
* they use very broad priors, so probably no biase towards this

## Regression towards the mean

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.cap="Example of true mean and variation, and of regression to the mean (Barnett et al. 2005)"}
knitr::include_graphics("True_mean_and_variation.jpg")
```

## What is critical about the paper / improvement
* regression towards the mean?
 + Did the people sampling data favor good positions?
* Unknown covariate has to be something else, maybe plot selection

## How are we planning to reanalyse it
* not using all years of plots
+ to treat for regression towards the mean
* code chunks

## Further description of Our plan to reanalyse it

## what do we expect from our reanalysis

## How could our reanalysis be restricted
