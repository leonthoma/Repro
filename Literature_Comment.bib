  abstract = {Several studies on mass loss during breeding in female birds have shown a significant correlation between initial body mass and subsequent loss of body mass. The significant positive regression coefficient of mass loss on initial mass was interpreted as evidence for a greater mass loss of initially heavier birds. However, the positive correlation between mass loss and initial mass arises automatically even when initial and final body masses are uncorrelated and has no necessary biological meaning. This is shown analytically here. In general, a spurious correlation arises when one variable (e.g. mass loss) is part of another variable (e.g. initial mass) and then regressed on it.},

  abstract  = {Abstract: If two successive trait measurements have a less‐than‐perfect correlation, individuals or populations will, on average, tend to be closer to the mean on the second measurement (the so‐called regression effect). Thus, there is a negative correlation between an individual’s state at time 1 and the change in state from time 1 to time 2. In addition, whenever groups differ in their initial mean values, the expected change in the mean value from time 1 to time 2 will differ among the groups. For example, birds feeding nestlings lose weight, but initially heavier birds lose more weight than lighter birds, a result expected from the regression effect. In sexual selection, males who remain unmated in the first year are, on average, less attractive than mated males. The regression effect predicts that these males will increase their attractiveness in the second year more than mated males. In well‐designed experiments, changes in the experimental and control groups would be compared. In observational studies, however, no such comparison is available, and expected differential effects must be accounted for before they can be attributed to external causes. We describe methods to correct for the regression effect and assess alternative causal explanations.},

  abstract = {Abstract In studies of treatment effects in clinical trials and longitudinal follow-up investigations, it is not unusual to inquire as to whether a relationship exists between the change of a variable and its initial value, for example pocket depth. Such studies must be carried out with great care, since the results are biassed by the regression towards the mean (RTM) effect. Examples are presented, the magnitude of the RTM effect is estimated and means of dealing with the RTM problem are discussed. RTM also appears as a selection phenomenon, emphasizing the need to include control groups in order to make possible adjustments for the bias caused by RTM.},

  abstract = {{Background Regression to the mean (RTM) is a statistical phenomenon that can make natural variation in repeated data look like real change. It happens when unusually large or small measurements tend to be followed by measurements that are closer to the mean.Methods We give some examples of the phenomenon, and discuss methods to overcome it at the design and analysis stages of a study.Results The effect of RTM in a sample becomes more noticeable with increasing measurement error and when follow-up measurements are only examined on a sub-sample selected using a baseline value.Conclusions RTM is a ubiquitous phenomenon in repeated data and should always be considered as a possible cause of an observed change. Its effect can be alleviated through better study design and use of suitable statistical methods.}},

  abstract  = {Global declines in insects have sparked wide interest among scientists, politicians, and the general public. Loss of insect diversity and abundance is expected to provoke cascading effects on food webs and to jeopardize ecosystem services. Our understanding of the extent and underlying causes of this decline is based on the abundance of single species or taxonomic groups only, rather than changes in insect biomass which is more relevant for ecological functioning. Here, we used a standardized protocol to measure total insect biomass using Malaise traps, deployed over 27 years in 63 nature protection areas in Germany (96 unique location-year combinations) to infer on the status and trend of local entomofauna. Our analysis estimates a seasonal decline of 76%, and mid-summer decline of 82% in flying insect biomass over the 27 years of study. We show that this decline is apparent regardless of habitat type, while changes in weather, land use, and habitat characteristics cannot explain this overall decline. This yet unrecognized loss of insect biomass must be taken into account in evaluating declines in abundance of species depending on insects as a food source, and ecosystem functioning in the European landscape.},
