## Introduction
* ~ 75 % decline in flying insect biomass over 27 years
* On protected sites of nature conservation
* Independent on weather, land-use, habitat characteristics
* ~ 80 % of the effects explaining declines are unknown
* Highest losses in times of highest biomass

## Our motivation to re-analyse the paper

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="110%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Image_relevance_of_paper.PDF")
```

## Aim for our re-analysis
* Comprehend the methods used by this highly relevant publication
* Asses the robustness of decline
* Therefore rule out any regression to the mean effect
* Enhance our skills in bayesian statistics

## Possible issues of the paper
* Years 1989 and 2014 are over-represented
* Few locations were re-sampled
* Only one trap per location
* The exposure time varies greatly among years
  + Longer in the later part of the data collection
* Unknown site selection procedure
* Lack of control group

## Why could this introduce an regression to the mean (RTM) effect?
* First time sampling a location --> exceptional high insect biomas
* Second (or third) time sampling the same location --> sampled biomass closer to true mean
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}

```

## Method to prove this hypothesis
* Only use the first observation of each location
  + no follow up or baseline observations appear
* Use the basic model of Hallmann et al.
  + Which was used for the prediction of the decline
  + Replicate the model specifications with an other subset of the data
* Models diagnostics
* Compare results of both analyses
* Asses the robustness of the stated decline

## Modelling of the insect biomass decline
* Bayseian model
* Priors
* Fixed and random effects
* Latent daily (but unobserved) biomass

## Results
* Our result (only first sampling of every plot) is within xx% of the original result
* No Regression to the mean found
* nice graphs

## Our Results and Hallmann et al.s
* Some other nice graphs

## What could be the reason for this similar results
* Hallmann et al. did a great job
* We did a bad job
* Better explanation :-)

## Slide 12

## Varying trapping exposure intervals
* The actual catches per trapping bottle did not strongly decline, the strong decline
only comes about when calculating values per day.
* biomass collection "saturation" phenomenon?

## Weak explanation of insect biomass decline
* Negative relationship between trees/forest and flying insect biomass
  + Insects might be flying higher
  + further succession of land (from arable to shrubland/forest) affects fling insects
* Only relevant drivers of decline could potentially only alter behaviour, not abundance of insects

## Overall performance of the analysis


## Improvement of the paper? 
* In this case, a controll group could be:
  + third or fourth sampling on each location

* @Blomqvist1987 emphasized the need to to include control groups
  + make adjustments for the RTM effect possible

## RTM in ecology
* needs to be further included in environmental sciences
  + "For example, birds feeding nestlings lose weight, but initially heavier birds lose more weight than lighter birds, a result expected from the regression effect." [@Kelly2005; @GebhardtHenrich2000]
